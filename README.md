# SoundCaptchaFHE

## Overview

SoundCaptchaFHE is a next-generation, privacy-preserving CAPTCHA system that leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to protect user interaction while enhancing AI resistance. Instead of the conventional text or image-based challenges, users complete a sound-based identification task. The system ensures that audio challenges and user responses remain encrypted, making it extremely difficult for automated bots or malicious AI to bypass verification.

## Project Background

Traditional CAPTCHA mechanisms face several challenges:

* **AI Circumvention**: Modern AI systems can often recognize images, text, or simple audio patterns with high accuracy.
* **Privacy Concerns**: Conventional CAPTCHAs collect user interactions in plain form, potentially exposing sensitive biometric information.
* **User Friction**: Many CAPTCHAs are frustrating or time-consuming, reducing user engagement.

SoundCaptchaFHE addresses these challenges by using FHE to perform encrypted verification of audio tasks without revealing the user's responses, balancing usability, security, and privacy.

## Features

### Core Functionality

* **Encrypted Audio Challenges**: Users receive a short encrypted audio clip and must identify specific elements (e.g., instrument type or sound pattern).
* **FHE-Based Verification**: Responses are submitted in encrypted form and verified directly on the server without decryption.
* **Adaptive Difficulty**: The system dynamically adjusts challenge complexity based on threat level and interaction history.
* **Universal Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across web and mobile platforms.

### Privacy & Security

* **Client-Side Encryption**: Audio challenges are encrypted before leaving the server; user responses remain encrypted on client devices.
* **No Raw Data Exposure**: At no point is user input or audio in plaintext transmitted or stored.
* **Bot & AI Resistance**: Encrypted processing prevents automated AI from reliably solving challenges.
* **Auditable Security**: All verification processes are logged in a privacy-preserving manner.

### User Experience

* **Accessibility-Friendly**: Designed to accommodate users with visual impairments.
* **Fast Response Times**: FHE optimizations ensure encrypted processing is efficient.
* **Minimal Interaction Steps**: Streamlined flow for smooth user experience.

## Architecture

### Backend System

* **FHE Engine**: Processes encrypted user responses and validates correctness without decryption.
* **Challenge Generator**: Creates diverse audio CAPTCHA challenges, stored in encrypted form.
* **Response Verifier**: Uses encrypted computation to verify correctness while preserving privacy.
* **Logging Module**: Securely logs user attempts for monitoring without storing sensitive data.

### Frontend Application

* **Web and Mobile Support**: Interactive interface for challenge playback and response input.
* **Audio Encryption Module**: Ensures all user responses remain encrypted.
* **Dynamic Challenge Player**: Plays audio and records responses with minimal latency.
* **Accessibility Features**: Support for keyboard navigation and audio cues.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

* Python with FHE libraries for encrypted computation
* Secure REST API for challenge distribution and verification
* Optimized audio processing modules

### Frontend

* React + TypeScript
* Audio capture and playback modules
* Tailwind CSS for responsive design
* Encrypted communication layer with backend

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js 18+
* Python 3.10+
* npm or yarn package manager
* Secure server environment for backend deployment

### Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install backend Python dependencies
3. Install frontend npm dependencies
4. Configure server environment variables
5. Start backend and frontend servers

## Usage

* **Challenge Access**: Users request a CAPTCHA challenge via frontend.
* **Solve Task**: Complete the audio identification task.
* **Submit Response**: Response is encrypted and sent to the FHE verification engine.
* **Receive Verification**: System confirms success or generates a new challenge if needed.

## Security Features

* **Encrypted Verification**: Responses remain encrypted throughout the process.
* **Privacy Preservation**: No personal data or raw audio is stored.
* **Tamper-Resistant**: FHE prevents server-side or network manipulation.
* **AI/Bot Resistant**: Encrypted sound challenges significantly raise difficulty for automated systems.

## Roadmap

* **Enhanced Challenge Diversity**: Incorporate multi-instrument audio and environmental sounds.
* **Mobile SDK Integration**: Provide lightweight SDKs for mobile apps.
* **Performance Optimization**: Reduce computational overhead of FHE verification.
* **User Analytics Dashboard**: Privacy-preserving metrics for administrators.
* **Cross-Platform Deployment**: Web, mobile, and embedded device support.
